# Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of maternal health risk prediction using machine learning techniques. Divided into two parts, the project focuses on leveraging data from the "IoT Based Risk Level Prediction Model For Maternal Health Care" dataset to develop predictive models and enhance maternal healthcare practices in Bangladesh.

## Part 1: Maternal Mortality Risk Prediction

In the initial phase, the project focuses on preparing and analyzing the dataset. Scripts such as data_preprocessing.py, statistics.py, and project1.py handle:

- Data Cleaning
- Visualization
- Feature Analysis.

The dataset is standardized, visualized, and explored to understand attribute relationships.

## Part 2: Maternal Health Risk Prediction Using Classification and Regression

Building upon the groundwork laid in Part 1, the second phase involves predicting maternal health risk levels using:

- Classification techniques
- Regression techniques.

 The objective is to categorize pregnancies into low, mid, or high-risk groups based on various pregnancy-related factors. Techniques like **Logistic Regression** and **k-nearest neighbors** are employed alongside **feature selection** and **cross-validation** for model evaluation.
