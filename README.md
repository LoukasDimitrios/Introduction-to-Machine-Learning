Maternal Mortality Risk Prediction


## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk level of maternal mortality based on the first six attributes. The project is structured into several key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Feature Extraction and Visualization: Gaining insights into the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
Model Development: Implementing various machine learning models to predict the risk level.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models and selecting the best one for deployment.
Prediction and Interpretation: Using the chosen model to predict risk levels and interpret the results.
