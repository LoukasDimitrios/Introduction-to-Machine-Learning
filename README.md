# Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of maternal health risk prediction using machine learning techniques. Divided into two parts, the project focuses on leveraging data from the "IoT Based Risk Level Prediction Model For Maternal Health Care" dataset to develop predictive models and enhance maternal healthcare practices in Bangladesh.

## Part 1: Maternal Mortality Risk Prediction

In the initial part, the project delves into preprocessing, feature extraction, visualization, and model development for predicting maternal mortality risk. Through a series of scripts, including data_preprocessing.py, statistics.py, and project1.py, the dataset is meticulously analyzed, standardized, and visualized. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for dimensionality reduction, while summary statistics and correlation matrices provide valuable insights into attribute relationships.

## Part 2: Maternal Health Risk Prediction Using Classification and Regression

Building upon the groundwork laid in Part 1, the second part of the project focuses on predicting maternal health risk levels through classification and regression methods. The main objective is to categorize pregnancies into low, mid, or high-risk groups based on various pregnancy-related factors. Utilizing techniques such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and ridge regression, alongside feature selection and nested cross-validation, the project aims to identify the most suitable models for accurate risk prediction.
